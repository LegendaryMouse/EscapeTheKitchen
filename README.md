# EscapeTheKitchen
In this hilarious roguelike game, you play as a man fighting against an army of sentient foods like tomatoes, carrots, and other grocery items. The catch? All the textures in the game are made in MS Paint! Dodge flying produce,  explore procedurally generated food-filled dungeons in this one-of-a-kind adventure.
